## Transcript

**You:** Thanks for making time today. What's driving this conversation?

**Sarah:** Honestly? Guest complaints. We just got our Q4 satisfaction scores and "room comfort" dropped 8 points. The board is asking questions. Our sofas are ten years old and it shows.

**Marcus:** We've been patching things up, reupholstering here and there, but it's getting ridiculous. Last month alone we spent $40K on repairs across properties. That's not sustainable.

**You:** How many units are we talking about?

**Marcus:** 847 sofas total. Mix of suites and standard rooms. The suites have sleeper sofas — those are the real problem. The mechanisms are failing constantly.

**David:** And they're ugly. I'm sorry, but they look like something from 2010. We're trying to position ourselves as design-forward boutique hotels and then guests walk into rooms with these dated pieces.

**You:** What have you tried so far?

**Sarah:** We looked at the big contract furniture suppliers. Williams & Hayes quoted us, but their lead time is 16 weeks. We can't wait that long — we have a major conference group booking our Chicago property in April. That's 200 rooms that need to look fresh.

**Marcus:** And their minimum order was 500 units. We wanted to pilot with one property first, maybe 60-70 sofas, see how they hold up before committing to the full rollout.

**You:** Makes sense. What about the sleeper mechanism issue?

**David:** That's actually why we're talking to you. Someone mentioned you have that proprietary fold system that doesn't require the mattress to be stored inside? That's huge for us. The traditional sleepers are so uncomfortable because the mattress is thin. Guests complain constantly.

**Sarah:** The housekeeping team hates them too. The mechanisms jam, sheets get caught. It adds 5 minutes to room turnover. Multiply that by hundreds of rooms...

**You:** What's your budget looking like?

**Marcus:** Look, we know quality costs money. We're prepared to spend $1,800-2,200 per unit for something that'll last. But here's the thing — we need flexible payment terms. Our Q1 cash flow is tight because of a renovation project. Ideally we'd do 30% upfront, remainder on delivery.

**Sarah:** The bigger issue is timeline. Chicago needs to be done by March 15th. Non-negotiable. We have the Midwest Healthcare Association conference and they're our biggest annual booking.

**You:** What about fabric and design requirements?

**David:** We want customization, but within reason. Each property has a slightly different color palette — earth tones for the mountain properties, cooler blues for coastal. But I don't want 12 completely different designs. Maybe 3-4 base designs with fabric variants?

**Marcus:** And whatever fabric you use needs to handle commercial cleaning. Our housekeeping uses pretty aggressive chemicals. The last sofas we bought from a residential supplier started looking terrible after six months.

**Sarah:** Fire rating too. We had a nightmare with our Phoenix property last year — inspector flagged all the lobby furniture as non-compliant. Cost us $50K to replace.

**You:** Anything else I should know?

**David:** Actually yes. We're opening two new properties next year — Portland and Austin. If this rollout goes well, those would be yours too. We're talking another 180 units.

**Sarah:** But first, prove it works. Chicago is the test. Hit that deadline, deliver on quality, and you'll have a long-term partner.

**Marcus:** One more thing — can you handle the old sofa removal? We don't have storage space for 70 old sofas at the Chicago property.
