# Commercial Proposal for Meridian Hotels

## Executive Summary

- **Problem:** Guest satisfaction dropped 8 points due to aging sofas, with $40K/month in repairs and a hard deadline for Chicago property refresh before April conference
- **Solution:** 70-unit pilot using EasyRest sleeper sofas with commercial-grade fabrics, delivered and installed by March 15
- **Result:** Modern, durable seating that eliminates mechanism failures, reduces housekeeping time, and positions Meridian as the design-forward brand you're building

---

## Understanding Your Situation

Your Q4 satisfaction scores told a clear story: "room comfort dropped 8 points." Ten-year-old sofas are showing their age, and as Marcus put it, you're spending "$40K on repairs across properties" just to keep things functional. That's not sustainable.

The sleeper sofas are the real pain point. Mechanisms jam, mattresses are thin, housekeeping loses "5 minutes to room turnover" per room fighting with the fold-out systems. Multiply that by hundreds of rooms and you're looking at serious operational drag.

You've tried the big contract suppliers. Williams & Hayes quoted 16-week lead times and 500-unit minimums. That doesn't work when you have the Midwest Healthcare Association arriving at Chicago in April and need 200 rooms looking fresh.

What you need is a partner who can:
1. Hit the March 15 deadline — non-negotiable
2. Let you pilot with 60-70 units before full commitment
3. Solve the sleeper mechanism problem permanently
4. Handle the old furniture so you're not storing 70 sofas somewhere

## Proposed Solution

### Product Configuration

**For Suites (Sleeper Sofas):**
- Model: Thornwood Meridian Series with EasyRest system
- The mattress stores separately — no thin, uncomfortable fold-out mattress
- Mechanism rated for 10,000+ cycles, zero jamming
- 6" memory foam mattress, closet-stored

**For Standard Rooms:**
- Model: Thornwood Metropolitan Series
- Clean transitional design, customizable to your palette
- High-density foam rated for 100,000+ compressions

**Fabric Program:**
- 3-4 base designs as David requested
- Earth tones for mountain properties, cooler blues for coastal
- All fabrics meet CAL 117-2013, tested at 100,000+ double rubs
- Compatible with commercial cleaning chemicals

### Why This Works

| Your Concern | Our Solution |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Mechanisms are failing constantly" | EasyRest has no internal mattress storage — nothing to jam |
| "Mattress is thin, guests complain" | Separate 6" memory foam mattress, real comfort |
| "Adds 5 minutes to room turnover" | Simple fold-out, no fighting with springs |
| "Need commercial-grade fabric" | All fabrics rated 100,000+ double rubs |
| "Fire rating compliance" | CAL 117-2013 standard on everything |
| "Can't wait 16 weeks" | Rush delivery: 6 weeks to installation |
